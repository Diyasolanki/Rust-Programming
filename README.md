<p>
1. Install Rust
If you haven't installed Rust yet, use rustup:
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

2. Verify the installation:
rustc --version

3. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/Diyasolanki/Rust-Programming.git
cd Rust-Programming

4. To compile the project, run:
cargo build 

5. Run the Rust Files
cargo run  # for everytime when you want to run your code

Note : If you using CamelCase in giving file_naming it will give an error it is not allowed in rust.
